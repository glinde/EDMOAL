1. Motivation for EDMOAL
1.1 Why yet an other data mining tool?

Many algorithms in data mining tools, work based on arrays of floating point values. For data that
can not be expressed by such an array, standard algorithms can't be used. However, most algorithms
only require a certain algebraic structure on the data objects, depending on the algorithm. Also
data structures sometimes require a certain algebraic structure rather than a specific form like
a floating point array.

EDMOAL is build to apply algorithms and data structures to their full potential, limited only by
the algebraic structure underlying the data. For example if a data mining algorithm only examines
the distances between data objects, it is not necessary to have a vector space algebra on top of the
data objects. DBScan is an example for such an algorithm. However, all the clustering algorithms
using prototypes as cluster representatives need a vector space on the data in order to compute
the locations of the prototypes. But both types algorithms are not restricted to floating point
arrays. Only the algebraic structure needs to be available for what ever data that should be
analysed. The same is true for some data structures. A k-d-tree for example needs an array
structure, but a ball-tree does not while a centered ball tree requires a vector space.

Keeping only the algebraic limits in mind for all algorithms and data structures enables it to
design one algorithm for all kinds of data, provided an algebraic structure can be provided for
the algorithm. Most other data mining tools to my knowledge are not capable of that or only very
limited.

1.2 The efficient E in EDMOAL

The algorithms provided in EDMOAL are designed to save first and foremost computation time where
possible without obfuscating the code. Also they are designed to use as little memory as possible.
For example for Fuzzy-c Means, it is not required to store the membership matrix during the
clustering process, so it is not done.

In most other data mining tools, algorithms do not utilize a data structure in order to speed
up data mining processes. For example DBScan implemented naively is in O(n^2) with n being the
number of data objects. Implemented on a ball-tree requires roughly O(n*k*log_2(n)) with k being
the minimal number of data objects for clusters, which is much faster for large data sets.

The algorithms in EDMOAL are designed to require a certain data structure if that is necessary for
the algorithm. That data structure is not always determined by the algorithm, it just requires
some functionality like for example a nearest neighbour query. How that query is implemented is not
always important for the algorithm.

1.3 EDMOAL as an API

EDMOAL is not intended to be used as a stand alone tool. Providing a GUI for the general purpose
user requires a tremendous amount of work. Also EDMOAL should provide functionality for as many
projects and scientists as possible. Adding a GUI limits its use more than it extends it.
Therefore, there will be no easy to access GUI like in Weka, Knime or RapidMiner. EDMOAL is not
intended to be a alternative or competitor to these tools. It might be an enrichment.

The graphical representation of some algorithms is intended to be used for debugging purposes only.
It might be used for screenshots in scientific papers, but it needs to be adjusted by the user if
he wants more functionality than it currently has. There might be an other project in the future
to provide suitable graphical output for EDMOAL algorithms, but it is not on the TODO list yet.



2. How to use

EDMOAL is intended to be an API and should be used as such. It is provided as an eclipse project.
To use EDMOAL as is, create a new eclipse project with the provided project files and set the
classpath to the jars of the batik project in the lib-folder. After that, it should compile without
any problems.

To get a start on the existing functionality, the package "dataMiningTestTrack" contains some
examples how to use the algorithms on some artificially generated data.



3. The Basic Structure

3.1 Indexed Data Set

The core of all algorithms are the classes IndexedDataSet and IndexedDataObject. There are no
algorithms yet that can deal with dynamic data sets (that is, data sets that change during the
analysis process). The IndexedDataSet, once build and sealed, can not be changed any more. That
is important in order to interpret the results of the algorithms properly, or provide O(1)
access times for some functionalities in data structures. For that, some additional memory is
required as each IndexedDataObject contains a reference to the IndexedDataSet it is associated to
and an integer of its position in the array. However, that is a little price to pay because for
the functionality it provides, especially compared to the size of very complex data objects.

The IndexedDataObject is therefore a container for any class. This provides maximal freedom to
other developers that want to utilize their existing class structure and apply EDMOAL on them.
Data mining algorithms and data structures are then build on IndexedDataSets and IndexedDataObjects.

3.2 Data Structures

All data structures are required to implement an interface that masks their functionalities. This
is useful in order to use data structures based on their functionality and not based on the class
hierarchy. If algorithms use data structures, they should only use the functionality interfaces
unless they require a specific implementation of a data structure.

3.3 Data Mining Algorithms  

All data mining algorithms are embedded in a interface hierarchy describing its capabilities. All
is based on the interface "DataMiningAlgorithm" which just requires an algorithm to provide a
function that applies the algorithm and return the data set it is applied on. That implies that
the data set should be set in the constructor. All other interfaces the algorithms implement
reflect their abilities and the results they are able to produce.



4. The Future

In the near future, the first task will be to add satisfactory commentary to all classes. The other
tasks are more complex and may take more time. The tasks are roughly in the order of their
importance and therefore in their probable order of implementation:

1. Add matrix support classes (matrix algebra functions like inversion etc.) and add algorithms
like the full expectation maximization algorithm with Gaussian mixture models and Gustafson Kessel
FCM etc.
2. Add more clustering algorithms, especially hierarchical and density based algorithms.
3. Parallelize algorithms as far as possible using a predefined number of threads.
4. Add more algorithms, not only clustering algorithms.
5. Add a connection to openCL in order to further parallelize parts of the algorithms in case
a graphics card is present.
