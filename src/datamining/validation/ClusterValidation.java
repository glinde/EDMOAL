/**
 * This class provides a collection of standard cluster validation indices.
 * Some of the indices compare data objects pairwise. That is quite some effort for large data
 * sets. Therefore, there are two options, <code>PAIRWISE_DATAOBJECTS</code> and <code>PAIRWISE_PROTOTYPES</code>.
 * The former (<code>PAIRWISE_DATAOBJECTS</code>) indicates, that the exact, but cost intensive method is used.
 * The latter calculates first the weighted mean in form of a virtual prototype of a cluster and calculates
 * the prototype positions for calculations.<br>
 * 
 * The second option, if the cluster size is calculated <code>LINEAR</code> or  <code>SQUARED</code> is not
 * a performance option but rather how the user likes it to be applied either one might work.<br>
 * 
 * For all algorithms in this class, a paper reference is provided. However, even though the original
 * papers are cited, the actual implementations are followed by the habilitation thesis of Christian Borgelt:<br>
 *
 * See: Borgelt, C. Prototype-based Classification and Clustering, Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, Germany, 2005 http://www.borgelt.net/habil.html
 * 
 * @TODO: implement consistent cluster diameter calculations, especially some that do not require a vector space.
