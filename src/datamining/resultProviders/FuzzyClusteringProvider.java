/**
 * Fuzzy clustering algorithms do not assign data objects uniquely to one cluster like a crisp clustering algorithm.
 * They do it in a fuzzy manner, that is: they create a partitioning of the data set such that the
 * sum of membership values of one data object is 1. Therefore, the fuzzy assignment (membership values) for one data object
 * are always a list of double values between 0 and 1.<br>
 * 
 * This interface provides the functions to gain access to the fuzzy membership values, which are essentially the result
 * of the clustering algorithm.
