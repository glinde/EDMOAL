/**
 * The basic interface for all clustering algorithms. Clustering, in the sense of unsupervised classification.
 *  
 * There are two kinds of clusters,  active clusters and inactive clusters. If an algorithm
 * provides a dynamic number of clusters, only active clusters are interesting. But if a clustering
 * algorithm requires the number of clusters be known in advance to starting the clustering process,
 * active and inactive clusters becomes more interesting.<br>
 * 
 * Inactive clusters are clusters that are available in principle, but which have no data objects assigned to.
 * So if the number of clusteres is fixed from the start, the concept of inactive clusters allows
 * to adjust the number of relevant (=active) clusters. Usually, inactive clusters do not participate 
 * in the clustering procedure.<br>
 * 
 * Very abstract speaking, clustering is an analysis of the distances among data objects. Naturally,
 * that distance needs to be measurable in order to do any analysis. Therefore, a metric is required for all clustering
 * algorithms, independent of their nature.
