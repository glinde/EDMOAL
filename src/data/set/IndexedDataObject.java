/**
 * This class is the second part of the backbone of the EDMOAL analysis structure. It is simply
 * a container for an unspecified object of type <code>T</code>. The <code>IndexedDataObject</code>
 * provides merely additional information in order to provide a consistent indexing of the data at hand.
 * It can be regarded as similar to the container of a linked list or a tree. However, there is one
 * very important difference. The containers of lists and trees are usually not accessed openly. They are masked
 * by the data structure (e.g. the List class) and all access to the data is channeled through the data structure.
 * This is not the case for the <code>IndexedDataObject</code>. It is supposed to be in the open. In fact,
 * when dealing with data in the EDMOAL project, data should always be "carried around" in the
 * container of the <code>IndexedDataObject</code> and organized in a <code>IndexedDataSet</code> and all
 * classes and methods concerned with the organization of the data should also only access these container classes.<br>
 * 
 * The reason for this is the index integrity <code>IndexedDataObject</code> and <code>IndexedDataSet</code> provides.
 * This is a design decision that is done to simplify the handling of data for many different algorithms. If an
 * algorithm wants to provide additional information for a data set (for example a classification),
 * it just needs to provide a list, containing this additional data. The raw data is unaffected. This way, many
 * different algorithms can simultaneously provide different information for the same data set. The
 * index integrity of the <code>IndexedDataSet</code> guarantees, that the additional information is valid
 * if the data set is sealed. So it basically provides a 1:1 relationship between indices and data objects.<br>
 * 
 * Of course, all operations regarding the contents of the data, are performed on the data it self and not
 * on the <code>IndexedDataObject</code>. For this reason, the classes in the data.algebra package
 * (which perform operations on the type <code>T</code>) are applied directly on the type <code>T</code> while
 * classes in the data.set package are applied on <code>IndexedDataObject</code>, because they are concerned
 * with the organization of the data.<br>
 * 
 * Since index integrity is the key, <code>IndexedDataObject</code> also stores its own index under which it is
 * stored in the <code>IndexedDataSet</code>. The reason is, that it simplifies many access operations.
 * The index integrity is provided in order to have easy access to additional external information. This
 * information must be accessible in a fast way which can be done using the index, stored in the 
 * <code>IndexedDataObject</code>. Therefore, it is enough to pass the <code>IndexedDataObject</code> around
 * to know which additional information are associated with it, without having a lookup-table. Also the index
 * defines an ordering of <code>IndexedDataObject</code>s that can be used to optimize data structures. Together with
 * the <code>IndexedDataSet.instanceCounter</code>, the index defines a global ordering of all 
 * <code>IndexedDataObjects</code>s that are assigned to a <code>IndexedDataset</code>.
