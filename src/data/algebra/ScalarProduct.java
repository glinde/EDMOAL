/**
 * The scalar product is usually only specified for a vector space of type <code>T</code>. However,
 * it is not necessary to specify a vector space in order to provide the functionality
 * of a scalar product. <br>
 * 
 * Note, that in general, it is required to have an object of the inner type of a vector space as result of a scalar product.
 * So this is not the most general form of a scalar product that is possible.
 * Specifying an Object type as result of the scalar product (and x and y as vectors of this object type), it would prevent
 * using atomar data types as scalar product results. in particular, <code>double</code> would not be possible. To keep
 * the balance between generality and performance, only real values (ok, double-valued) scalar products are considered here.
 * If the extended functionality is required in the future, a complete rearrangement of the algebra package will be required.
